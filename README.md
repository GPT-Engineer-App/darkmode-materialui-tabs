# darkmode-materialui-tabs

Write a React project using MaterialUI that has tabs called "Nate", "World Ranks", and "State Ranks". Under each tab, there will be three components, "Candidates", "Configure", and "Preview". "Candidates" will be on top left of the screen. "Configure" will be on bottom left of the screen. "Preview" will be right half of the screen. There is also "Parsed" component which will toggle on and replace "Preview". 

Make theme darkmode.

Candidates component will have a list of URLs and "Parse" button next to it. The list of URLs will be retrieved from an API endpoint of same host at "/candidates", which will be returned in a JSON format as a list. When URL is clicked, there will be an iframe in Preview component to load the URL. When you click on "Parse" button, Preview component will change to "Parsed" component.
